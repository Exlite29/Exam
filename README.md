## 📝 Technical Reflections

The following section contains my original responses regarding project implementation and best practices:

● **How you handle API.** 
- I handle API through .env and making sure that in the gitignore its added.

● **How you handle different UI states.** 
- I handle different UI states through conditional rendering and state management. I also use loading and error states to display the appropriate UI.

● **Code performance.** 
- I try to make my code performant by using memoization and lazy loading. I also try to keep my code optimized for performance.

● **Your understanding in React.** 
- I have a good understanding of React and its ecosystem. I have worked on several React projects and have a good understanding of its features and best practices.
